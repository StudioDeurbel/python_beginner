# Hello! I am now giving you a course on writing a Number Word script!
# Write your answer in another script. Start by creating your variable by writing something simple,
# then add a space and then =
example =
# this will be the number variable. Now add another space, and then int(input("Number: "))
example = int(input("Number: "))
# great! Now you have the first line of code! Now add another variable:
example = int(input("Number: "))
example2 =
# now add a second space and then input("Word: ")
example = int(input("Number: "))
example2 = input("Word: ")
# your second line is ready! Now let's go faster! Add this to your third line: for _ in range(*your first variable name*):
example = int(input("Number: "))
example2 = input("Word: ")
for _ in range(example):
# bam! Third line! Now below print(*your second variable*)
example = int(input("Number: "))
example2 = input("Word: ")
for _ in range(example):
    print(example2)
# now execute that code!
